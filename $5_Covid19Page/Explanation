### ðŸ”¹ Step 1 â€“ Start with a Brief Introduction

*"I have built a COVID-19 Awareness web page using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The idea of the project is to present important information about COVID-19, such as test details, symptoms, and prevention tips, in a simple and visually clear format."*

### ðŸ”¹ Step 2 â€“ Explain the Structure (HTML part)

\*"I used HTML5 to create the structure of the page. The page is divided into different sections:

* A **top section** with the main heading, an illustration, and a â€˜Know Moreâ€™ button.
* A **COVID-19 Test section** that gives a short description with an icon.
* A **Symptoms section** with cards showing common symptoms like dry cough, high fever, and headache.
* A **Videos section** that includes a title, description, doctor image, and a â€˜Watch Videoâ€™ button.
  For this I used basic HTML elements such as headings (`<h1>, <h2>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), images (`<img>`), buttons (`<button>`), and containers (`<div>`)."\*

### ðŸ”¹ Step 3 â€“ Explain Styling (CSS part)

\*"For styling, I used **CSS3** along with **Bootstrap flex utilities** for layout.

* I applied **background colors, borders, and rounded corners** to create card-like sections.
* Used **flexbox** (`d-flex`, `flex-row`, `flex-column`) to align elements horizontally and vertically.
* Managed spacing with **margin, padding, and gap**.
* Set dimensions for images and buttons with **height and width**.
  This gave the project a clean and responsive design."\*

### ðŸ”¹ Step 4 â€“ Talk About Learning Outcomes

*"From this project, I learned how to structure a web page properly using semantic HTML, how to style elements consistently using CSS, and how Bootstrapâ€™s flexbox utilities can simplify responsive layouts. It also helped me understand the importance of designing user-friendly interfaces."*

### ðŸ”¹ Step 5 â€“ Conclude Professionally

*"Overall, this project helped me strengthen my **frontend development skills** and taught me how to combine HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap effectively to build simple yet informative web pages."*
