\*\*"I developed a Tourism Website project using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
The main purpose of this project is to showcase different tourist destinations in an attractive and user-friendly way.
I divided the website into multiple sections to make the navigation smooth and structured.
The first section is the **Landing Page**, where I used a background image along with a 'Get Started' button. 
This section works like the entry point of the website and immediately grabs the user’s attention with visuals.

The second section is the **Favourite Places section**. 
Here, I displayed a set of popular tourist places using cards that contain images, headings, and short descriptions.
This section gives a quick overview of different destinations so that users can explore them at a glance.

The next part is the **Detailed View section**, where I provided more complete information about a particular tourist place.
In this section, the images are larger and the description is more detailed, 
so users can learn more about the history or specialty of that place.

Apart from these, I also included a **Bootstrap Carousel section**. 
This is basically a slideshow of images that makes the website more interactive and visually appealing.
Users can click on the navigation arrows or dots to view multiple pictures of tourist spots.

For smooth navigation, I used **buttons** like Back, Home, and Get Started.
Each button is connected to a small JavaScript function that switches between sections, so users don’t have to scroll manually. 
This gives the feeling of a small web application rather than just a static page.

From the styling point of view, I applied **CSS properties** like background images, text colors, font styles, padding, and margin to make the layout neat. 
I also used **Bootstrap’s grid system and flexbox utilities** to arrange the content in a responsive way, so the website looks good on both desktops and mobile screens.

Through this project, I learned how to structure content properly using HTML, how to style elements with CSS, and 
how to take advantage of Bootstrap components like carousels, flexbox, and responsive design. More importantly, 
I understood how to divide a project into sections, make navigation simple, and focus on user experience.
Overall, this project not only improved my technical skills but also gave me confidence to build professional-looking websites."\*\*
